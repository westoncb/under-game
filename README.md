# Under

[![run on repl.it](http://repl.it/badge/github/westoncb/under-game)](https://repl.it/github/westoncb/under-game)

Under is a minimal game written in JavaScript and GLSL with procedural graphics produced mostly by noise, signed distance functions, and [boolean/space-folding operators](http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/) applied to those functions. The codebase is small and fairly well-documented.

## Project Background
I recently wrapped up a contract and had some free time on my hands, so I decided to make something 80% for fun. The other 20% was to test out some architecture ideas and to see if I could learn something about my personal bottlenecks in doing side projects. I originally planned to spend only 5 days on it, but that rapidly turned into 9 (full days), and I've been tweaking it and adding sounds when I get a few free moments since. So it's an approximately 10 day project.

The pure fun part was largely that I already knew pretty clearly how to make the game—and in fact, I'd made essentially the [same game](http://symbolflux.com/statichtml/oldprojects/wormgame.html) about 12 years ago—and I knew the technologies involved well, so I could focus almost solely on experimenting with making pretty graphics in GLSL using distance functions and creative ways of combining them (such as you'd run into on e.g. [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)). Additionally, I could enjoy the contrast in what I was able to do with the same project now vs. 12 years go when I was first learning to code :)

The architecture experiment concept is summed up in something I tweeted the other day:

*How about an architecture like a discrete dynamical system driven by events instead of time, where the state evolution and event generation logic changes according to a quasi-FSM where nodes are defined by boolean functions (of system state) instead of explicit graph structure?*

(Note: my conception was only clear enough to describe it that way after mostly completing this project. What you'll find in the code here isn't quite so neat.)

I was reading about about 'simulating the physical world' via Jamie Wong's [excellent article](http://jamie-wong.com/post/simulating-the-physical-world/) and then started thinking about how 'normal' apps are different, and whether they could benefit by sharing some ideas. It seemed to me that Redux for instance must have been inspired by thinking along these lines (no idea if that's true), and that the general notion of 'operation' has a strong resemblance to differentials in a numerical integration process.

The other aspect of the architecture experiment was to attempt a pragmatic balance between functional and OO styles. I did all my high-level planning in terms of pure functions, and felt like I'd got most of the app's essentials down in that fashion—but once I started coding I let go of any strict constraints on functions being pure or data being immutable, hoping that the functional conception of the main structures/algorithms would be sufficient in whatever traces it left.

I had an overall positive experience with the architecture. There are still some kinks to work out, but my plan is to extract a super minimal library/framework from it to use in future projects. I partly want that for doing more games—but I'm also curious how it would extend to domains outside of games.

## Code Overview
If you want to get to the meat of how the game itself works, it's all in [gameStateTransformer.js](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/gameStateTransformer.js)

It uses [quadShaderCanvas.js](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/quadShaderCanvas.js) to set up three.js with a single rectangular Mesh using a ShaderMaterial, which is fit exactly to the canvas dimensions. All of the visuals are created by a fragment shader applied to that Mesh surface.

The fragment shader is in [gameFragmentShader.js](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/gameFragmentShader.js). I've written a few of these now, but I'm still no pro. Expect some rookie mistakes. And I'd be glad for some optimization tips if anyone notices some easy changes that could be made...

The cave shape generation is done in [caveGenerator.js](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/caveGenerator.js)

The entry point to the code is in [index.js](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/index.js). It sets up the main update/render loop and initializes a Simulation object, telling it to use a GameStateTransformer.

There are a few framework-ey classes which are the primary components of the 'architecture experiment' described above. They are:

- [StateTransformer](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/stateTransformer.js)
- [Simulation](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/simulation.js)
- [Events](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/events.js)
- [EvolveAid](https://github.com/westoncb/under-game/blob/master/js/evolveAid.js)

**StateTransformer** is the core structure of the framework. The idea is that programs would be defined as a set of StateTransformers (potentially arranged in a hierarchy, but no use of that is made here—in fact this program only uses one real StateTransformer). And Each StateTransformer defines logic for transforming some state in response to a sequence of events and/or time passage. It will also likely _generate_ its own events when certain conditions are met, or in response to system input events. As an example, GameStateTransformer generates an event when the worm collides with the cave wall.

**Simulation** is a special StateTransformer which does the actual work of triggering the methods defined by StateTransformers at the correct times. It is always active and manages some actual StateTransformer.

**Events** is a simple queue. Events may be added to it like `Events.enqueue('event_name', eventData);`. Every frame/step while the app is running Simulation will remove events from the queue one at a time, passing them to the current StateTransformer via a call to `activeStateTransformer.handleEvent(event);`.

**EvolveAid** EvolveAid makes 'transient state' and 'contingent evolvers' work (these are used by StateTranformers). Check out the documentation in evolveAid.js for more info. (Thinking about it, this probably should have just been a part of Simulation.)


## Build and Run
```
git clone https://github.com/westoncb/under-game
cd under-game
npm install
```


index.html loads `./build/bundle.js`. I wasn't sure about best practices for including build software in the package.json for an open source javascript project like this. I imagine you could build with whatever you prefer. I used Watchify personally, which you can set up like:

```
npm i watchify
watchify ./js/index.js -o './build/bundle.js'
```

Then I serve the project with `http-server` (`npm i http-server`):
```
http-server -p 4000
```

Unfortunately, because of concerns I have about licensing issues with the sound files, they are not included in the repo; so when you run the game locally it will be silent unless you add your own sounds :/
